    <h2>Tutorial</h2>
    <h3>Mathythm is a game with numerous mathematical puzzles. In each puzzle two numbers (the current number and the goal number) are shown, and you are challenged to reach the goal number by clicking on the toolbar, which contains two operations.</h3>
    <h3>From Level 1 to Level 10, you should aim for the minimum number of steps. Starting from Level 11, you should aim for speed, and the game will end if the countdown reaches zero.</h3>
